# MultipassPP

This plugin implements a framework for writing multipass post processing effects using scene view extensions. It also includes two example post processing effects, a deinterlacing style effect and an accumulation motion blur effect.

If you want to write your own effect using the framework, take a look at [InterlacePPSceneExtension](Source/MultipassPP/Private/InterlacePPSceneExtension.cpp) and [AccumulationMotionBlurSceneExtension](Source/MultipassPP/Private/AccumulationMotionBlurSceneExtension.cpp).
